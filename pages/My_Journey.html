	My Journey

<!-- THE INTRODUCTION OF THE PAGE -->
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
	In this page, I will introduce my journey.
</div>

<!-- Section 1： Early Years -->
<h3 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #2c3e50; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
    Early Years
</h3>

<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
	Throughout my early years, I continued my studies while often contemplating the meaning of life. Back then, I saw studying as torture that contributed nothing to greater causes. I disliked classmates who only focused on academics, and by chance, I joined the school's robotics club. We created an excellent robot that won a gold medal in the national competition. With this robot, we traveled to the United States to compete - my first time abroad and my first visit to America.

</div>

<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">

	<br>If the story had followed this trajectory, I should have pursued a career as a technical expert, continuing to study robotics and eventually becoming an accomplished engineer. However, in my youth, there were too many temptations and desires, yet too little action on my part. I wanted to make money and do things typical of young people, so when I returned to school, I put robotics behind me. Back then, I could never have imagined that ten years later, I would return to this untraveled path. Perhaps this is what destiny had in mind...

    Gap Year, The First Transition
</h3>
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">

	After completing my Bachelor's degree, I was overwhelmed by a profound sense of meaninglessness regarding study and work. This led me to postpone my Master's studies in pursuit of life's deeper meaning. During this period of self-discovery, I immersed myself in philosophical readings, particularly finding resonance in Albert Camus' 'The Myth of Sisyphus', while engaging in community volunteer work, traveling, and corporate internships.

</div>
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
    
	<br>Camus' perspective on finding meaning in the seemingly meaningless provided clarity to my existential questions. This period led me to embrace absurdism - accepting life's inherent meaninglessness and repetitive nature. Like Sisyphus finding peace in his eternal task, I came to terms with life's mundane aspects and decided to pursue conventional paths of success. This acceptance manifested in my decision to return to academia for a Master's degree while simultaneously engaging in corporate work, viewing these routines not as burdens but as natural elements of existence.

    Period at Shanghai, All about Working and Business
</h3>
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
    These three years in Shanghai were crucial in my life. I took on several jobs, attempted various business ventures, and tried almost everything I could think of and was capable of doing. Moreover, it was here that I met my love.

<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
	
	<br>I made money, had a home, and everything seemed perfect - life could have just continued this way. However, my partner and I often discussed the meaning and value of life, and we felt it would be too indulgent to retire at such a young age. We wanted to return to our youthful aspirations and pursue our dreams.

<!-- Section 4: COVID-19, The Second Transition -->
 <br>
<h3 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #2c3e50; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
    COVID-19, The Second Transition
</h3>
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
	Following my initial acceptance of life's absurdity, I had embraced both academic and professional pursuits, establishing myself successfully in Shanghai, China's most prosperous city, through various business ventures. However, a series of events - the sustained impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the challenging period of Shanghai's lockdown, and the loss of a friend - collectively triggered a profound shift in my worldview. Each of these experiences highlighted human vulnerability and life's uncertainty, compelling me to reevaluate my understanding of life's meaning.
	
</div>
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">

	<br>Through continued philosophical exploration, combined with new insights from psychology and observations of massive societal changes, I reached a transformative realization: while understanding life's inherent meaninglessness remains valuable, actively creating meaning and pursuing positive change holds even greater significance. This new perspective inspired a mission to contribute to building a highly automated, technologically advanced society. 
	
</div>
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">

	<br>Moving beyond my previous philosophical stance of accepting life's monotony, I now actively seek to create impact through education and personal growth, dedicating myself to human progress. This conviction led me to pause my business operations in Shanghai and return to academia to study computer science and robotics, while leveraging online resources for practical knowledge. My pursuit of a second Master's degree stems not from passive acceptance, but from a genuine desire to contribute meaningfully to society and infuse my life with purposeful action.
